# MNIST DCGAN Training

This repository contains the code to train a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) on the MNIST dataset.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to set up and run the training script.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pandas
- imageio

### Installation

Ensure you have the required packages installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib pandas imageio
```

## Running the Training Script
### Navigate to the current directory:
```bash
cd /root/autodl-tmp/xin/Model-Bias-in-Training-with-Generated-Data/DCGAN
```
### Run the training script:
```bash
nohup python /root/autodl-tmp/xin/Model-Bias-in-Training-with-Generated-Data/DCGAN/pytorch_MNIST_DCGAN.py > output.txt 2>&1 &
```

This command will start the training process in the background and redirect all output (standard and error) to output.txt.
